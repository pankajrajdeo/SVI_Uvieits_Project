## **Core Analysis Scripts**

These scripts perform the primary analyses of the project and are located in their respective subdirectories within `2_Scripts/`.

### **`2_Scripts/1_complications_analysis/`**

*   **File**: `svi_complications_analysis.py`
*   **Purpose**: To determine if higher SVI is associated with a greater lifetime prevalence of ocular complications.
*   **Inputs**: `SVI_Pankaj_data_1_updated_merged_new.csv`
*   **Outputs**:
    *   `svi_vs_comp_count_stats.csv`: CSV with mean complication counts by SVI quartile.
    *   `svi_vs_any_comp_proportion_stats.csv`: CSV with the proportion of patients having any complication.
    *   `svi_vs_mean_comp_count_plot.png`: Bar chart of mean complication counts.

    3.  Groups patients by their JIA subtype.
    4.  Calculates the mean SVI for each subtype.
    5.  Performs ANOVA to test if the mean SVI is significantly different across the subtypes.

*   **Key Logic**:
    1.  Loads data and calculates SVI.
    2.  For each QOL instrument (PedsQL, CHAQ, etc.), it finds the relevant columns.
    3.  It processes the raw text-based answers (e.g., "Often a problem") into numerical scores and then transforms them into a standardized 0-100 scale (higher = better QOL).
    4.  It runs the full analysis suite (ANOVA, regression) for each QOL score against SVI for both the `JIA-Only` and `Any Uveitis` groups.
    5.  Generates and saves all plots and summary tables.

These scripts are located in `2_Scripts/utils/` and serve general purposes.

*   **File**: `update_csv.py`
    *   **Purpose**: A data management script used to merge or update the main CSV file from another CSV file. It matches rows based on patient identifiers.
    *   **Note**: You should not need to run this unless you are given a new, separate data file to merge into the main dataset.

*   **File**: `plot.py`
    *   **Purpose**: To generate a specific, multi-panel summary figure named `SVI_Onset_Treatment_Figure.png`.
    *   **Note**: This script appears to be for creating a custom figure for a presentation or paper, combining results from the onset and treatment delay analyses.

## **How to Run Scripts**

To run any analysis script:

1. Navigate to the appropriate directory in `2_Scripts/`
2. Ensure the data file is in the correct location (`1_Data/1_Raw/`)
3. Run the script with Python:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
4. Check the corresponding directory in `3_Results/` for outputs

All scripts are designed to be self-contained and will generate their outputs in the appropriate `3_Results/` subdirectory.
