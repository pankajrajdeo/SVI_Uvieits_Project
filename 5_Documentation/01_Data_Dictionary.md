# **01: Data Dictionary**

---

This document provides a description of the primary dataset and a dictionary of its most important columns used throughout the project's analyses.

## **Primary Dataset**

*   **File Name**: `SVI_Pankaj_data_1_updated_merged_new.csv`
*   **Description**: This is the central and most current dataset for the project. It is a comprehensive, patient-level file that merges demographic information, clinical data, diagnosis codes, procedural and medication history, lab results, and Quality of Life (QOL) survey responses. Each row likely represents a patient encounter or a summary of a patient's data.

## **Key Columns Reference**

This is a reference for the most critical columns used in the analysis scripts. The original dataset contains over 500 columns; this list is curated to highlight those essential to the project's core hypotheses.

### **Patient Identifiers**

| Column Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `global subject ID` | A unique identifier for each patient. Used for grouping all data related to a single individual. |
| `locus study id` | Another form of patient identifier, likely from a specific registry or study. |

### **Independent Variable (The Cause)**

| Column Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `svi_socioeconomic (list distinct)` | The SVI theme score related to community poverty, unemployment, and education. Raw data is often a semicolon-separated string if multiple values exist. |
| `svi_household_comp (list distinct)` | The SVI theme score related to single-parent households, disability status, etc. |
| `svi_housing_transportation (list distinct)` | The SVI theme score related to housing quality, crowding, and access to vehicles. |
| `svi_minority (list distinct)` | The SVI theme score related to the concentration of racial/ethnic minorities and non-English speakers. |
| `SVI_total` | **(Generated by scripts)** A calculated field representing the patient's overall Social Vulnerability Index. It is the mean of the four theme scores above. This is the primary independent variable in most analyses. |
| `SVI_quartile` | **(Generated by scripts)** A categorical variable that groups patients into four equal-sized groups based on their `SVI_total` (Q1 = Least Vulnerable, Q4 = Most Vulnerable). |

### **Grouping & Stratification Variables**

| Column Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `dx code (list distinct)` | A critical column containing semicolon-separated ICD diagnosis codes. This is used to stratify patients into the main analysis groups (`JIA-Only` vs. `Any Uveitis`). |
| `ilar_code_display_value (list distinct)` | Contains the specific JIA subtype diagnosis (e.g., Oligoarticular, Polyarticular). Used in the JIA subtype analysis. |
| `Diagnosis_Group` | **(Generated by scripts)** The final analysis group for a patient (`JIA-Only` or `Any Uveitis`), derived from the `dx code` column. |

### **Outcome Variables (The Effects)**

| Column Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `exam left vadcc (list distinct)` | Visual acuity measurement for the left eye (VADCC = Vision, Distance, Corrected with glasses/contacts). One of the key inputs for the visual acuity analysis. |
| `exam right vadcc (list distinct)` | Visual acuity measurement for the right eye. |
| `Worst_Overall_LogMAR_...` | **(Generated by scripts)** The final, calculated visual acuity score for a patient on the LogMAR scale (higher = worse vision). |
| `cmeyetrt (list distinct)` | A free-text column listing eye-related treatments, including steroid eye drops. Used to identify patients for the steroid duration analysis. |
| `medication name (list distinct)` | A free-text column listing various medications. Used to identify complications (e.g., glaucoma medications) and treatment patterns. |
| `procedure name (list distinct)` | A free-text column listing procedures. Searched for keywords like `'cataract'` or `'surgery'` in the complications analysis. |
| `pedsql .* c \(list distinct\)` | A pattern representing multiple columns for the PedsQL QOL survey (child-reported). The text responses in these columns are the raw input for QOL score calculation. |
| `eqv5y .*` | A pattern representing multiple columns for the EQ-Vision QOL survey. |
| `child dress`, `child walk`, etc. | Individual columns for the CHAQ QOL survey. |
