# **03: Figures and Results Interpretation**

---

This document provides an interpretation of the key figures generated by the project's analysis scripts. The goal is to explain what each plot shows and what the clinical or scientific takeaway is.

## **1. Complications Analysis Figures**

*   **Generated by**: `2_Scripts/1_complications_analysis/svi_complications_analysis.py`

#### **Figure: `svi_vs_any_comp_proportion_plot.png`**

*   **What it Shows**: This is a bar chart that displays the percentage of patients who have experienced at least one major ocular complication (like cataracts or glaucoma). The y-axis is the percentage of patients, and the x-axis shows the four SVI quartiles (Q1=Least Vulnerable, Q4=Most Vulnerable). There are separate bars for the "JIA-Only" and "Any Uveitis" groups.
*   **Interpretation**: The bars for the "Any Uveitis" group show a clear, stepwise increase from left to right. This is a key finding: **As social vulnerability increases, the likelihood of a patient with uveitis having at least one major complication also increases significantly.** The p-values noted at the top of the chart confirm that this trend is statistically significant.

#### **Figure: `grouped_complications_any_uveitis.png`**

*   **What it Shows**: This is a more detailed bar chart that focuses only on the "Any Uveitis" group. It breaks down the complications into specific types: Cataract, Glaucoma, Synechiae, and Surgery. For each SVI quartile on the x-axis, it shows the percentage of patients who have had each specific complication.
*   **Interpretation**: This plot allows us to see which specific complications are driving the overall trend. For example, you can see that the prevalence of cataracts and glaucoma dramatically increases in the Q3 and Q4 SVI groups. This provides strong evidence that **higher social vulnerability is associated with a higher risk of developing specific, vision-threatening complications.**

## **2. Quality of Life (QOL) Analysis Figures**

*   **Generated by**: `2_Scripts/5_qol_analysis/svi_qol_analysis.py`

#### **Figure: `Figure3_SVI_QoL_MultiPanel.png`**

*   **What it Shows**: This is a summary figure with multiple panels. Each panel is a bar chart for a different Quality of Life survey (PedsQL, CHAQ, EQ-Vision). The y-axis is the mean QOL score (where higher is better), and the x-axis shows the SVI quartiles. Separate bars are shown for the JIA-Only and Uveitis groups.
*   **Interpretation**: This is one of the most important figures in the project. Across all three panels, the orange bars (Uveitis patients) show a consistent downward trend. This means that **for patients with uveitis, as social vulnerability increases, their self-reported quality of life significantly decreases.** This holds true for their overall health (PedsQL), physical function (CHAQ), and vision-related quality of life (EQ-Vision). The asterisks and p-values noted above the bars indicate where these differences are statistically significant.

#### **Figure (Example): `pedsql_total_score_child/Any_Uveitis_svi_regression.png`**

*   **What it Shows**: This is a scatter plot where each dot is a single patient from the "Any Uveitis" group. The x-axis is the patient's continuous `SVI_total` score, and the y-axis is their PedsQL QOL score. The plot includes a blue "line of best fit".
*   **Interpretation**: The downward slope of the line indicates a negative correlation. **This means that there is a continuous, linear trend where a higher SVI score is associated with a lower QOL score.** The RÂ² and p-value in the title quantify this relationship. A significant p-value (typically < 0.05) confirms that this trend is not likely due to random chance.

## **3. Visual Acuity (VA) Analysis Figures**

*   **Generated by**: `2_Scripts/7_va_analysis/svi_va_analysis.py`

#### **Figure: `svi_vs_worse_va_proportion_plot_FINAL.png`**

*   **What it Shows**: This bar chart displays the percentage of patients with poor vision, defined as 20/50 or worse. The y-axis is the proportion of patients meeting this criterion, and the x-axis shows the SVI quartiles. It primarily focuses on the "Uveitis" group, as vision loss is the main outcome for them.
*   **Interpretation**: The bars get progressively taller from left to right. This is a critical finding: **Patients from more socially vulnerable communities are significantly more likely to have poor visual outcomes.** This directly links social factors to the most feared outcome of uveitis: vision loss.

#### **Figure: `logmar_analysis_by_group/Uveitis_logmar_by_svi_boxplot.png`**

*   **What it Shows**: This is a box plot for the "Uveitis" group. The y-axis shows the worst-recorded visual acuity on the LogMAR scale (where higher values mean worse vision). The x-axis shows the four SVI quartiles.
*   **Interpretation**: The boxes, which represent the median and interquartile range of vision for patients, trend higher in the Q3 and Q4 groups. This reinforces the finding from the bar chart, showing that not only are more patients affected, but the **overall distribution of vision is worse for patients in more vulnerable communities.**

## **4. Treatment Delay Analysis Figures**

*   **Generated by**: `2_Scripts/8_treatment_delay_analysis/svi_treatment_delay_analysis.py`

#### **Figure: `treatment_delay_boxplot_by_group.png`**

*   **What it Shows**: This box plot displays the time from diagnosis to treatment initiation across SVI quartiles and patient groups.
*   **Interpretation**: The plot shows that **patients in higher SVI quartiles experience longer delays in receiving treatment**, which may contribute to the worse outcomes observed in other analyses.

## **5. Steroid Duration Analysis Figures**

*   **Generated by**: `2_Scripts/6_steroid_duration_analysis/svi_steroid_duration_analysis.py`

#### **Figure: `Any_Uveitis_duration_by_svi_boxplot.png`**

*   **What it Shows**: This box plot shows the duration of steroid eye drop use across SVI quartiles for uveitis patients.
*   **Interpretation**: **Patients in higher SVI quartiles tend to have longer durations of steroid use**, suggesting more persistent inflammation and potentially more severe disease.

## **6. Onset and Treatment Analysis Figures**

#### **Figure: `SVI_Onset_Treatment_Figure.png`**

*   **Generated by**: `2_Scripts/utils/plot.py`
*   **What it Shows**: This is a two-panel figure.
    *   **Panel A (Line Plot)**: Shows the mean age of disease onset for JIA and Uveitis across the SVI quartiles.
    *   **Panel B (Bar Chart)**: Shows the mean time (in weeks) from diagnosis to the start of the first major systemic medication.
*   **Interpretation**:
    *   The key finding is in **Panel B**. It shows that for JIA-Only patients, the time to treatment is dramatically longer for those in the highest SVI quartile. This suggests that **children from more vulnerable communities face significant delays in getting the medication they need** to control their disease, which is a likely driver of the other poor outcomes observed in the project.

## **7. Demographic Analysis Figures**

*   **Generated by**: `2_Scripts/2_demographics_analysis/`

#### **Figure: `svi_demographics_halves_chart.png`**

*   **What it Shows**: This chart displays demographic characteristics stratified by SVI halves (low vs high vulnerability).
*   **Interpretation**: **Patients in higher SVI halves are more likely to be from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds and have different socioeconomic characteristics**, providing context for the clinical outcome differences.

## **Key Clinical Takeaways**

1. **Social vulnerability is a powerful predictor of adverse outcomes** in pediatric JIA and uveitis patients.

2. **Treatment delays** appear to be a key mechanism through which social vulnerability leads to worse outcomes.

3. **Vision-threatening complications** are significantly more common in patients from more vulnerable communities.

4. **Quality of life** is substantially impacted by social vulnerability, particularly for uveitis patients.

5. **Interventions targeting social barriers** may be necessary to improve outcomes for high-risk patients.

These findings suggest that addressing social determinants of health is not just a matter of equity, but may be clinically necessary to improve outcomes for all children with these chronic conditions.
