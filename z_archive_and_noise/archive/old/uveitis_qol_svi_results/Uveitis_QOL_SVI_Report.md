# Quality of Life and Social Vulnerability in Pediatric Uveitis Patients

## Overview
This report analyzes the relationship between social vulnerability index (SVI) and quality of life (QOL) measures specifically in pediatric patients with uveitis. The analysis examines how social determinants of health may influence physical functioning, emotional wellbeing, social interactions, pain management, and vision-related quality of life.

## Methods
The analysis included 125 patients with confirmed uveitis diagnoses. Quality of life was assessed using multiple validated instruments:

- **PedsQLâ„¢**: Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (emotional, physical, social functioning, and pain domains)
- **CHAQ**: Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (physical function)
- **Pain and Function Sliders**: Visual analog scales for pain intensity and overall function
- **Vision-Related QOL**: EQ-Vision measures specific to vision-related quality of life

Patients were stratified by SVI quartile, where Q1 represents the lowest social vulnerability and Q4 represents the highest. All QOL measures were standardized to a 0-100 scale where higher scores indicate better outcomes.

## Patient Characteristics
- Total uveitis patients analyzed: 125
- Patients by SVI quartile:
  - Q1 (Low): 57 patients (45.6%)
  - Q2: 1 patients (0.8%)
  - Q3: 33 patients (26.4%)
  - Q4 (High): 34 patients (27.2%)

## Key Findings

### Data Availability
- Pedsql Emotional Score: 116 patients (92.8%)
- Pedsql Physical Score: 116 patients (92.8%)
- Pedsql Social Score: 116 patients (92.8%)
- Pedsql Pain Score: 116 patients (92.8%)
- Pedsql Total Score: 116 patients (92.8%)
- Chaq Function Score: 116 patients (92.8%)
- Pain Slider Score: 28 patients (22.4%)
- Function Slider Score: 28 patients (22.4%)
- Vision Qol Score: 103 patients (82.4%)

### Overall Quality of Life Scores
- Pedsql Emotional Score: Mean = 61.4, Median = 60.4 (Range: 0.0-100.0)
- Pedsql Physical Score: Mean = 87.3, Median = 100.0 (Range: 50.0-100.0)
- Pedsql Social Score: Mean = 70.8, Median = 87.5 (Range: 0.0-100.0)
- Pedsql Pain Score: Mean = 59.7, Median = 50.0 (Range: 0.0-100.0)
- Pedsql Total Score: Mean = 69.8, Median = 75.0 (Range: 18.8-100.0)
- Chaq Function Score: Mean = 76.1, Median = 66.7 (Range: 0.0-100.0)
- Pain Slider Score: Mean = 100.0, Median = 100.0 (Range: 100.0-100.0)
- Function Slider Score: Mean = 0.0, Median = 0.0 (Range: 0.0-0.0)
- Vision Qol Score: Mean = 74.8, Median = 66.7 (Range: 50.0-100.0)

### No statistically significant differences were found between SVI quartiles for any QOL measure.

### Largest Differences Between Lowest and Highest SVI Quartiles
- **Pedsql Social Score**: Q4 scores 52.0 points lower than Q1 (Q1: 91.7 vs. Q4: 39.7)
- **Pedsql Emotional Score**: Q4 scores 42.8 points lower than Q1 (Q1: 73.7 vs. Q4: 30.9)
- **Pedsql Total Score**: Q4 scores 31.3 points lower than Q1 (Q1: 82.2 vs. Q4: 50.9)

## Interpretation

The analysis did not find statistically significant differences in quality of life measures across SVI quartiles in this cohort of pediatric uveitis patients. This could suggest that:

1. The impact of uveitis on quality of life may transcend socioeconomic boundaries
2. The current standard of care for pediatric uveitis might help mitigate potential disparities
3. The limited sample size, especially in some SVI quartiles, may have affected statistical power

Despite the lack of statistical significance, there was a notable 52.0-point lower score in Pedsql Social Score among patients from high vulnerability areas. This trend warrants further investigation with larger sample sizes.

## Clinical Implications

Based on these findings, several clinical implications emerge for the care of pediatric uveitis patients:

1. **Standardized Approach**: Continue current comprehensive care approaches that may be helping to mitigate SVI-related disparities.

2. **Vigilant Monitoring**: Maintain vigilance for potential emerging disparities in quality of life outcomes.

3. **Enhanced Assessment**: Consider more nuanced assessment tools that might better capture quality of life differences across SVI quartiles.

## Limitations

Several limitations should be considered when interpreting these results:

1. **Sample Size**: The sample includes only 125 uveitis patients, with uneven distribution across SVI quartiles (particularly Q2).

2. **Cross-Sectional Design**: This analysis represents a snapshot in time and cannot establish causality or temporal relationships.

3. **Missing Data**: Not all QOL measures were available for all patients, potentially introducing bias.

4. **Confounding Factors**: The analysis does not control for potential confounders such as uveitis severity, duration, treatment differences, or comorbidities.

5. **Self-Reported Measures**: QOL assessments are based on self-report (or parent-report) and may be influenced by reporting biases that vary across socioeconomic groups.

## Conclusion

While this analysis did not find statistically significant differences in quality of life across SVI quartiles, the trends observed suggest that social vulnerability may still influence certain aspects of life for pediatric uveitis patients. Further research with larger sample sizes and longitudinal designs is needed to better understand these relationships and ensure equitable outcomes for all children with uveitis, regardless of socioeconomic status.
