# The Impact of Social Vulnerability on Clinical Outcomes in Pediatric JIA and Uveitis

---

## **Project Overview**

This project investigates the association between community-level social vulnerability and clinical outcomes in a cohort of pediatric patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) and associated Uveitis. The primary goal is to determine if children living in more socially vulnerable communities experience a greater burden of disease, including a higher rate of vision-threatening complications, poorer quality of life, and worse visual acuity.

The core hypothesis is that higher social vulnerability, as measured by the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), is associated with adverse clinical outcomes in this patient population.

## **Directory Structure**

The project is organized into the following main directories:

*   **`1_Data/`**: Contains the raw and processed datasets used in the analyses.
    *   `1_Raw/`: The original, untouched data.
    *   `2_Processed/`: Processed and cleaned data files.

*   **`2_Scripts/`**: Contains all Python scripts for the project, organized by analysis type.
    *   Each sub-directory (e.g., `1_complications_analysis/`, `5_qol_analysis/`) contains the specific script for that analysis.
    *   `3_Utils/`: Contains utility scripts for tasks like plotting and data updates.

*   **`3_Results/`**: Contains all output files from the analysis scripts, organized by analysis type.
    *   Each sub-directory (e.g., `1_complications_analysis/`, `5_qol_analysis/`) contains the figures and data tables generated by the corresponding script.

*   **`4_Reports/`**: Contains final reports, presentations, and abstracts related to the project.

*   **`5_Documentation/`**: Contains detailed documentation for the project, including a data dictionary, a guide to the Python scripts, and interpretation of the results.

*   **`z_archive_and_noise/`**: Contains archived files and older versions of analyses that are not part of the main project.

## **How to Run the Analysis**

The analysis scripts are located in the `2_Scripts/` directory. Each analysis is self-contained in its respective folder.

To run an analysis, navigate to the script's directory and execute it using Python. For example, to run the Quality of Life analysis:

```bash
cd 2_Scripts/5_qol_analysis/
python svi_qol_analysis.py
```

The script will read the necessary data from the `1_Data/` directory and save its output (figures and tables) to the corresponding directory in `3_Results/`.
