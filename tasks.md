## Data Analyses / Tables Requested:

1. SVI domains (socioeconomic, housing/transportation, minority, household composition) for JIA-no-U vs JIA-U combined group

2. Uveitis complications at initial visit by SVI quartile (synechiae, band keratopathy, cystoid macular edema)

3. Visual acuity at initial visit and SVI quartile

4. Steroid drops duration and SVI quartile

5. Table 1: Methotrexate start time and uveitis diagnosis (to see if uveitis led to earlier MTX use)

6. Other patient outcomes vs SVI: EQ-5D, CHAQ

7. JIA severity at presentation vs SVI quartile (ideally JADAS score, if available in RheumSmart)

8. Summary table of SVI components for JIA-U vs JIA-no-U

9. Clarify: # of patients excluded due to no address information


## Other Notes from Mentors:

1. Define inclusion/exclusion criteria clearly

2. Clarify analytic approach / bioinformatics methods (Drs. Sheila + Ginny emphasized this)

3. Consider separating results by group (JIA-U, JIA-no-U, uveitis-only) for clarity

4. Check whether JIA kids had more severe/longstanding disease (delayed diagnosis)

5. See if SES differences correlate with earlier systemic IMT initiation (LOCUS data)
